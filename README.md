# HeavenClient
HeavenClient is a custom, made-from-scratch game client.

# Supported versions
The client is currently compatible with version 83 servers.
The client has only been tested with [HeavenMS](https://github.com/ronancpl/HeavenMS).
For the UI file, a v154+ version should be used.

# Configuration
The build can be configured by editing the **Journey.h** file. The following options are available:
- **JOURNEY_USE_CRYPTO**: Use cryptography when communicating for the server.
- **JOURNEY_USE_XXHASH** : Use xxhash for file check (additional dependency)
- **JOURNEY_USE_ASIO**: Use Asio for networking (additional dependency)

The default settings can be configured by editing the **Configuration.h** file. These are also generated after a game session in a file called **Settings**. These can be altered in the same way as **Configuration.h**, although, these do not persist if you delete the file, unlike **Configuration.h**.

# Building
1. Open **MapleStory.sln** in Visual Studio 2017 CE
2. Make sure to use **Windows SDK Version: 8.1** and **Platform Toolset: v140** (If you don't have these, download them)
   * [Windows 8.1 SDK](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/downloads/sdk-archive)
3. Press **Build** > **Build Solution** or **Ctrl + Shift + B**
4. After a successful build, you can now run the program by pressing **Debug** > **Start Debugging** or **F5**
5. Make sure all nx files are present in the parent folder.
   - For a list of files required navigate to **NxFiles.h**
6. To convert wz files to nx you can use the [NoLifeStory.zip](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1Mk3Kq1lY4NTMqylN5sn0-DQNAcoZZRYH)
   - Extract the zip
   - Place your wz files in the **files** folder
   - Run **start.bat**
7. Next you have to fix a difference in the client or your server
   - Navigate to **LoginParser.cpp: 109**
   - Change:
`statsentry.stats[Maplestat::LEVEL] = recv.read_short();`
   - To:
`statsentry.stats[Maplestat::LEVEL] = recv.read_byte();`
   - Or change your server to send the level as a short instead of a byte
