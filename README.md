# HeavenClient
HeavenClient is a custom, made-from-scratch game client.

# Supported versions
- The client is currently compatible with version 83 servers.
- The client has only been tested with [HeavenMS].
- **[Switch]**
- **[Linux]**

# Configuration
The build can be configured by editing the **MapleStory.h** file. The following options are available:
- **USE_ASIO**: Use Asio for networking (additional dependency)
- **USE_CRYPTO**: Use cryptography when communicating for the server.
- **USE_NX**: Use NX files instead of WZ files.
- **USE_DEBUG**: This suppresses the generation of the Settings file

The default settings can be configured by editing the **Configuration.h** file. These are also generated after a game session in a file called **Settings**. These can be altered in the same way as **Configuration.h**, although, these do not persist if you delete the file, unlike **Configuration.h**.

# Building
1. Open **MapleStory.sln** in Visual Studio 2019 CE
2. Make sure to use **Windows SDK Version: 8.1** and **Platform Toolset: v140** (If you don't have these, download them.)
   * [Windows 8.1 SDK]
3. Press **Build** > **Build Solution** or **Ctrl + Shift + B**
4. After a successful build, you can now run the program by pressing **Debug** > **Start Debugging** or **F5**.
5. Make sure all NX files are present in the parent folder. To convert WZ files to NX you can use the [NoLifeWzToNx] project.
   - Extract the zip
   - Place your WZ files in the **files** folder
   - Run **start.bat**
   - See **Required Files** for a list of required NX files

# Required Files
